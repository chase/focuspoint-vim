# FocusPoint: an epic color file for Vim

After hours upon hours of coding, my eyes began to beg for mercy from
the friendly and warm colors of Molokai. I sought to improve
the wonderful theme and FocusPoint is the product.

# Installation

* Copy 'focuspoint.vim' to your ~/.vim/colors folder.
* That's it!

or use this little terminal trick:
`curl https://github.com/chase/focuspoint-vim/raw/master/colors/focuspoint.vim > ~/.vim/colors/focuspoint.vim`

# Notes

There is no 256 color mode, as I prefer VIM defaults when accessing a
remote system through SSH.
